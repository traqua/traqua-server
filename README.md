 Aqua Pi: an innovative water management solution for in the home.
 
 We are a team of secondary school students working on this project like it's our full-time job. We believe that water is becoming a scarce resource and is a privilege to many people in the modern world; because of this, we'd like to help people use water more effectively and efficiently. Our project consists of a smart hub system, with a home hub - the Raspberry Pi - which collects data from water outlets around the home, giving you an overview of your water usage. We are using the Raspberry Pi to act as a data interpreter and a reporting device. At water outlets around the house, we use Arduino Pro Minis, connected to a flow meter and radio, to communicate with the Raspberry Pi. The Raspberry Pi itself is responsible for taking the rate of flow and passing it through an algorithm to calculate live, daily and monthly water usage. As well as this, the Raspberry Pi hosts a web page on a local web server, accessible to everyone on the Wi-Fi network.
